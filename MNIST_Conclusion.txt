Conclusion: The network's size can be large or small. In MNIST case the network with one hidden layer performed the best on test data.

+ RESULTS:
- You will get the best results for test accuracy when you have:
1- BEST RESULT at:
Hidden Layers:one
Ouput nodes:784,256
Total Epochs:50
Batch Size:128
Level of Saturated epoch while training:50
Training Accuracy: 99.97
Test Accuracy: 98.51
---
Note: We got same results as above when using two hidden layers with output nodes of 512,256,256 at a total epochs of 90/100


-2nd best:
Hidden Layers:three
Ouput nodes:512,128,128,64
Batch Size:320
Total Epochs:50
Level of Saturated epoch while training:50
Training Accuracy: 99.94
Test Accuracy: 98.29



- 3rd best results:
Hidden Layers:Nil
Ouput nodes:512
Batch Size:112
Total Epochs:25
Training Accuracy: 99.99
Test Accuracy:98.24
Level of Saturated epoch while training: 21


+Relation of parameters with training accuracy:
- As the hidden layer increases, you need more epochs for maintaining accuracy
- If you do overtraining(training more after the optimum epoch) then you will see reduction in test accuracy.
- Batch size, epochs, hidden layers ==> you must find the optimum one
- no. of output nodes of input layer greater than hidden layer gives better accuracy.


+Future work:
We will try how to mitigate overfitting
